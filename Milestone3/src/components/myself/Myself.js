        I am currently a B-Tech Computer Science student at Banasthali Vidyapith pursuing a undergraduate degree.
        I am always curious about things and enjoy learning. I believe that the things I learn from dynamic 
        environment and competitive university life define me and I am looking forward to implement and polish 
        them in any opportunity I receive.
